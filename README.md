IAG's Email Security Service has automatically blocked and quarantined an email addressed to you that contains at least one executable file.
Executable files can contain harmful code that can download malicious software to your computer.

As a preventative measure, executable files will only be permitted through the IAG Email service once a Mail Administrator has checked its legitimacy.

Therefore, if you believe the email below is legitimate, please complete the form in the self service portal to request for the email to be released by following the link below.
